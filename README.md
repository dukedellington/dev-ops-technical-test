# DevOps Engineer - technical-test
We think infrastructure is best represented as code, and provisioning of resources should be automated as much as possible.

Your task is to write an YAML script using AWS  CloudFormation to provision an auto scaling web application for higher availability which could use load balancer, EC2 instances,auto-scaling, AWS RDS, Amazon S3, Route 53, Amazon SNS. 

In the YAML scripts, please try to put inline comments . 


## Context
We are testing your ability to implement modern automated infrastructure, as well as general knowledge of system administration. In your solution you should emphasize readability, maintainability and DevOps methodologies.

## Submit your solution
Create a public Github repository and push your solution(Yaml script) in it. Commit often - we would rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When you're finished, send us the URL to the repository. We are expecting to receive your solution within next 24 Hours.
